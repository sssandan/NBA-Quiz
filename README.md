# NBA-Quiz
Test your NBA knowledge! How well do you know the players? The history? Come find out!

I learned how to make this app through an iOS course in Udemy.com (Angela Yu and the London App Brewery). This course 
is awesome because I'm learning a ton of things at my own pace. I learned about the MVC (model-view-controller) 
pattern for designing apps, labeling and views, data encapsulation, etc. I still want to change some things about it. 
For example, I want to add an option to choose between categories (NBA Players, Playoffs, Regular Season, etc).
